# Architecture
- Evaluate the whole architecture before creating new directories. Ensure new modules or directories fit the overall design and follow Clean Architecture and Clean Code principles.

# Security
- Use best security practices: validate and sanitize all user inputs, avoid hardcoding secrets, use environment variables for sensitive data, keep dependencies up to date, and apply the principle of least privilege.

# Code Quality
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. Follow style guides, use meaningful names, write tests, and refactor when necessary.

# Documentation
- Keep documentation up to date, including README and setup/deployment instructions.
